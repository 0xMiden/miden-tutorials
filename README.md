# miden-tutorials

The goal of this repository is to provide clear and practical examples for interacting with the **Miden Rollup**. These examples are designed to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for developers exploring Miden's capabilities.

This repository is organized into two main parts:

1. **rust-client**  
2. **web-client**

---

## Directory Overview

### 1. `rust-client`  

The `rust-client` directory contains examples for interacting with the Miden Rollup using **Rust**. These examples demonstrate how to:

- Connect to the Miden Rollup.  
- Perform transactions.  
- Query on-chain data and interact with smart contracts.

If you are building smart contracts, CLI tools, or services that leverage the Miden Rollup, this is the place to start.

### 2. `web-client`  

The `web-client` directory contains examples for interacting with the Miden Rollup **in the browser**. These examples showcase how to:

- Connect to Miden from a web-based environment.  
- Send transactions and retrieve data using the web client.  
- Build user-friendly interfaces for Miden-powered dApps.

If you are working on a frontend application or web integration, this directory will be most relevant.
