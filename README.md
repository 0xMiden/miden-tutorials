# miden-tutorials

The goal of this repository is to provide clear and practical examples for interacting with the **Miden Rollup**. These examples are designed to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for developers exploring Miden's capabilities.

This repository is organized into several parts:

1. **docs**
2. **node**
3. **rust-client**  
4. **web-client**

---

## Overview

### 1. `docs`

The `docs` directory contains the README files for the tutorials and guides.

### 2. `node`

The `node` directory contains the necessary config files for running the miden-node locally.

### 3. `rust-client`  

The `rust-client` directory contains examples for interacting with the Miden Rollup using **Rust**. 

If you are building smart contracts, CLI tools, or services that leverage the Miden Rollup, this is the place to start.
