# Deploying a Counter Contract

*Using the Miden Client in Rust to Deploy a Counter Contract*

*In Progress*


In this tutorial, we're going to build a counter smart contract that other users can increment. In the first part of this tutorial we will deploy the counter contract to Miden and in the second part of this tutorial we will call various functions in the smart contract.


To run the counter contract example:
```bash
cargo run --release --bin counter_contract_script
```
