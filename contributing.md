## Markdown Formatting with Prettier

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure our Markdown files are consistently formatted.

### Installation

- **Global Installation:**

  ```bash
  npm install -g prettier
  ```

- **Local (Dev Dependency) Installation:**

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev prettier
  ```

### Formatting Files

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
prettier --write "**/*.md"
```

Make sure to run this command before submitting pull requests.

Thank you for contributing!
