# Introduction

This repository contains concrete, basic tutorials and examples of how to build applications on Miden. The goal is to make getting up to speed with building on Miden as quick and simple as possible.

All of the tutorials are accompanied by code examples in Rust and TypeScript, which can be found in the [Miden Tutorials](https://github.com/0xPolygonMiden/miden-tutorials) repository.

This repository is organized into several parts:

1. **docs** - contains the README files for the tutorials and guides.
2. **masm** - contains the Miden assembly notes, accounts, and scripts used in the examples.
3. **node** - contains the necessary config files for running the miden-node locally.
4. **rust-client** - contains examples for interacting with the Miden Rollup using **Rust**. 
5. **web-client** - contains examples for interacting with the Miden Rollup in the browser.
