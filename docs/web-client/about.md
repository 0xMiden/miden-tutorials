# Web Client

The Miden Web client can be used for a variety of things, including:

* Deploying and creating transactions to interact with accounts and notes on Miden.
* Storing the state of accounts and notes in the browser.
* Generating and submitting proofs of transactions.
* Submitting transactions to delegated proving services.

This section of the docs is an overview of the different things one can achieve using the Web client, and how to implement them. 

Keep in mind that both the Web client and the documentation are works-in-progress!
